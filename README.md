## About This Script

It is pretty boring to run same command everytime to start mirroring Android device wirelessly  
so I write a script for it.  

# Setup
Run following command to give excution permission.  
chmod 700 ./scrcpy-connect.sh

## Getting Started

1.Connect wifi to be in same local network (you can also open shared hotspot).  
2.Connect Devices with usb  
3.Run with:  
&nbsp ./scrcpy-connect.sh  
4.Start scrcpy
